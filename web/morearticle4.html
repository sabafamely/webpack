            <h1>User Interface (UI) Design</h1>
            <p>
                User Interface (UI) Design focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a digital product, such as
                buttons, menus, icons, typography, and colors. While User Experience (UX) is about how a product works,
                UI is about how it looks and feels during interaction. A well-designed UI creates a bridge between users
                and technology, ensuring that people can easily understand and navigate a product.
                UI design is not just about beauty; it’s about clarity, consistency, and usability. The goal is to
                create interfaces that are visually appealing while also being functional and intuitive.
            </p>

            <h2>Why is UI Design Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First Impressions Matter: Users often judge the quality of a product by its interface.
                </li>
                <li> Ease of Use: Clear and simple UI elements make it easy for users to complete tasks.
                </li>
                <li>Brand Identity: Colors, typography, and style reflect the brand’s personality and values.
                </li>
                <li>Increased Engagement: An attractive interface encourages users to stay longer and explore more.
