            <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
            <p>
                Web Accessibility refers to designing and developing websites, applications, and digital tools in a way
                that they can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. The goal of accessibility is to
                remove barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites. A truly accessible website
                ensures equal opportunity for all users, regardless of their abilities.
                Accessibility is not just a technical requirement; itâ€™s a fundamental principle of inclusivity. By
                making websites accessible, businesses not only comply with legal standards but also demonstrate social
                responsibility and expand their audience.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Why is Web Accessibility Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Equal Access for All Users: Ensures that people with disabilities can fully use and benefit from
                    digital platforms.</li>
                <li> Legal Compliance: Many countries have regulations (such as WCAG or ADA) that require digital
                    accessibility.</li>
                <li>Better User Experience: Accessible design improves usability for everyone, not just people with
                    disabilities.
                </li>
                <li>Wider Audience Reach: Accessible websites attract more users, increasing engagement and conversions.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Key Principles of Web Accessibility (WCAG Guidelines)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Perceivable: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive, such as text alternatives for
                    images or captions for videos.</li>
                <li>Operable: Users must be able to navigate and interact with a website easily, including with
                    keyboards or assistive devices.
                </li>
                <li>Understandable: Information and interface should be clear, predictable, and easy to follow.
                </li>
                <li>Robust: Content should work across different technologies, including assistive tools like screen
                    readers.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Techniques for Achieving Accessibility
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding alt text to images</li>
                <li>Providing keyboard navigation support
                </li>
                <li>Using sufficient color contrast between text and background
                </li>
                <li>Structuring content with proper HTML headings and landmarks
                </li>
                <li>Adding captions and transcripts for multimedia content
                </li>
                <li>Testing websites with assistive technologies like screen readers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Web Accessibility is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities,
                can access and benefit from the web. By following accessibility standards like WCAG and focusing on
                inclusive design, developers and businesses can create digital experiences that serve all users equally.
                Accessibility is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity to reach a broader audience and build
                a more inclusive internet.
